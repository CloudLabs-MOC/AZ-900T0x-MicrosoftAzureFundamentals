# Lab Scenario Preview: 

## Lab 07 - Implement an Azure IoT Hub

### Lab overview

In this walkthrough, we will configure a new Azure IoT Hub in Azure Portal, and then authenticate a connection to an IoT device using the online Raspberry Pi device simulator. Sensor data and messages are passed from the Raspberry Pi simulator to your Azure IoT Hub, and you view metrics for the messaging activity in Azure Portal.

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Create an IoT hub
- Add an IoT device
- Test the device using the Raspberry Pi Simulator
