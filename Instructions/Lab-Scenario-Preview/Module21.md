# Lab Scenario Preview: AZ-900: Azure Fundamentals: Describe Azure management and governance

## Lab 21 - Calculate Composite SLAs

### Lab overview

In this walkthrough, we will determine availability SLA of Azure services and then calculate application composite SLA-based expected availability.

Our example application consists of these Azure services. We will not go in to deep architectural configuration and considerations, the intention here is to give an high level example.

+ **App service**: To host the application.
+ **Azure AD B2C**: To authenticate user logins and manage profiles.
+ **Application Gateway**: To manage application access, and scaling. 
+ **Azure SQL Database**: To store application data. 

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Determine the SLA uptime percentage values for our application
- Calculate the Application Composite SLA percentage uptime
