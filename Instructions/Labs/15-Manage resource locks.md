# Lab 15 - Manage resource locks

In this walkthrough, we will verify the existing resource group, add a lock to the resource group and test deletion, test deleting a resource in the resource group, and remove the resource lock. 

## Objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:

+ Task 1: Verify the existing resource group
+ Task 2: Add a Lock to the resource group and test deletion
+ Task 3: Test deleting a member of the resource group
+ Task 4: Remove the resource lock

## Estimated timing: 20 minutes

# Task 1: Verify the existing resource group

In this task, we will verify the existing resource group for this exercise. 

1. Click on the **Azure Portal** icon on the VM desktop and log in with the **Username** and **Password** provided in the Lab Environment Tab.

2. From the **All services** blade, search for and select **Resource groups**, then view the existing resource group.

# Task 2:  Add a Lock to the resource group and test deletion

In this task, we will add a resource lock to the resource group and test deleting the resource group. 

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the existing resource group **myRGLocks-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />**.

2. You can apply a lock to a subscription, resource group, or individual resource to prevent accidental deletion or modification of critical resources. 

3. In the **Settings** section, click **Locks**, and then click **+ Add**.

4. Configure the new lock. When you are done click **OK**. 

    | Setting | Value | 
    | --- | --- |
    | Lock name | **RGLock** |
    | Lock Type | **Delete** |
    | | |

5. Click **Overview** and click **Delete resource group**. Type the name of the resource group and click **Delete**. You receive an error message stating the resource group is locked and can't be deleted.

# Task 3: Test deleting a member of the resource group

In this task, we will test if the resource lock protects a storage account in the resource group. 

1. From the **All services** blade, search for and select **Storage accounts**, and then click **+ Create**. 

2. On the **Basics** tab of the **Create storage account** blade, fill in the following information. Leave the defaults for everything else.

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Subscription | **Select your subscription** |
    | Resource group | **myRGLocks-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />** |
    | Storage account name | **storageaccount<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />** |
    | Location | **(US) East US**  |
    | Performance | **Standard** |
    | Replication | **Locally redundant storage (LRS)** |


3. Click **Review + Create** to review your storage account settings and allow Azure to validate the configuration. 

4. Once validated, click **Create**. Wait for the notification that the account was successfully created. 

5.  Wait for the notification that the storage account was successfully created. 

6. Access your new storage account and from the **Overview** pane, click **Delete**. You receive an error message stating the resource or its parent has a delete lock.

    **Note**: Although we did not create a lock specifically for the storage account, we did create a lock at the resource group level, which contains the storage account. As such, this *parent* level lock prevents us from deleting the resource and the storage account inherits the lock from the parent.

# Task 4: Remove the resource lock

In this task, we will remove the resource lock and test. 

1. Return to the **myRGLocks-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />** resource group blade and, in the **Settings** section, click **Locks**.
    
2. Click the **Delete** link to the right of the **RGLock** entry.

3. Return to the storage account blade and confirm you can now delete the resource.

   Congratulations! You created a resource group, added a lock to the resource group and tested deletion, tested deleting a resource in the resource group and removed the resource lock. 

   **Note** : **Wait for 10 minutes before heading to the Validation Step**
